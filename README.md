# hackerspace

_This is a prototype built at [Valley Hackathon](https://valleyhackathon.com) - Stockton Mini-Hack July 2018 by [@ideaguy3d][ideaguy3d] and [@bwestover][bwestover]._

If you don't arrive to a hackathon with an already formed team, it can be awkward to present your skills, background, desires, and/or ideas to others.

Hackerspace aims to help with the common problem of finding teammates and/or a project to work on at a hackathon. It allows hackers to quickly view profiles posted by others looking for a team, and post their own profile for others to find.
